# 📊 Adult Income Classification – Machine Learning Project
 
A machine learning project that predicts whether a person's income exceeds $50K/year based on demographic and employment data, using the Adult Income Dataset.
 
## 🔍 Overview
 
This project covers a full data science workflow — from data cleaning and preprocessing to training and evaluating multiple classification models.
 
## ⚙️ Steps & Techniques
 
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, handling missing values and unknown entries (`?`)
- **Categorical Encoding:** Converting text columns using `LabelEncoder`
- **Correlation Analysis:** Using heatmaps to explore relationships between features and the `income` target
- **Feature Scaling:** Applying `MinMaxScaler` to numerical columns
- **Outlier Handling:** Using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method for capping/removal
- **Model Training:**
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), with automatic selection of the best K value
  - Decision Tree Classifier (tuned with GridSearchCV)
  - Logistic Regression
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report for each model
## 🧰 Tech Stack
 
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
 
## 📁 Dataset
 
Adult Census Income dataset (`adult.csv`) — predicts income category based on features like age, education, occupation, work hours, and more.
